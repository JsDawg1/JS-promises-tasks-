Just some random basic tasks for learning Promise in javascript

Task-1 :

Fetch data from an API using the fetch function and handle the promise with .then() and .catch().

Task-2 : 

Simulate an asynchronous operation using a promise and setTimeout.

Task 3: 

Chain two promises using .then() to perform asynchronous operations one after the other.

Task 4:

Use Promise.race() to simulate a race between two promises and log the result of the promise that resolves first.

Task 5: 

Use Promise.all() to wait for multiple promises to resolve and log all the results together.





all the answer (atleast for the unknows) are mentioned in the script.js file, feel free to look around solution
